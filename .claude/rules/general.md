This is a personal dotfiles repo. Changes should be minimal and targeted.

- Use `zsh` syntax for all shell scripts (not bash/POSIX)
- Never hardcode paths — use `$DOTFILES_PATH`, `$HOME`, or relative paths
- The default branch is `master`
- When adding new features, follow the existing patterns exactly
- Prefer single-line changes over restructuring existing files
